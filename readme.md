# React navigation

Here you can find a basic frontend navigation made from scratch, using the sidebar component.  
Every page displays a basic component that make use of React props and state system.

This project is based on the course "Modern React with Redux" by Stephen Grider (<https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/>), chapters from 10 to 16.
